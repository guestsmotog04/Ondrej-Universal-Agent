    Thio's Universal Agent
    <br>
</h1>

An AI desktop assistant app capable of interacting with your entire computer (and any apps) like you do.

## What It Does (And Why "Universal"?)

**Simply put, it works across the whole computer.** Unlike most AI "computer use" tools which only work in a browser or via command line, this uses the computer like you do.

It controls Windows purely through visual perception and GUI interaction. By interpreting raw pixels and sending hardware-level input (mouse movements, clicks, keystrokes), it operates exactly like a human would. This makes it **universally compatible** with any graphical application on your machine.

## Demonstration

Example of it queuing multiple actions at once, while accurately clicking exact coordinates within the <i>entire</i> 4K screen.

# Example Use Cases

- Ask it to _show_ you how to do something instead of just getting a text description like other AIs.
- Ask it to troubleshoot some error you're getting and figure out the cause.
- Ask it to visually find an image in a folder of un-labelled files, based on a description.
- Tell it to check every 10 seconds if a video render is done, then when it is, copy the file somewhere.
    - (Though not recommended to leave unattended, unless in a controlled sandbox environment)


# Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q:** Is this like OpenClaw or Hermes?
**A:** No, this is not intended to be a 24/7 running agent. It also doesn't rely on CLI/Shell commands. It's meant for individual tasks or problems you'd normally have to do yourself. Give it a "goal", sit back, and it will start moving the mouse, clicking, typing, etc. just like you would.

### **Q:** How long _can_ it run?
**A:** There's not actually a limit. You can set the max number of steps to any number in the settings. The default is arbitrarily set to 100 steps.

### **Q:** Which AI Services are supported?
**A:** Currently  ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. Your own API key is required. Currently it seems Gemini works the best, especially `gemini-flash-latest`

### **Q:** Doesn't this use a ton of tokens?
**A:** Sort of, but not as much as you might think. Each step is maybe 3k tokens, but input tokens are cheaper. Completion tokens are usually as few as 50, up to a few hundred for many queued actions. The big factor is how many thinking tokens are used.
  - For example, with Gemini 3.5 Flash, it seems each step with a single action costs about 1 cent or less.
  - I recommend setting thinking to the minimum, but even then it may use a few thousand tokens if it's going to queue up a lot of actions.
  - There's also context mitigation logic, such as summarization context every X steps, and removing past images from the context window (Both can be disabled in settings)

### **Q:** Can I do other stuff while it's going?
**A:** Not really. It won't block your mouse or keyboard input or anything. But it's best to not touch anything while it's running to prevent interfering. You can do little stuff between steps to help it though, like if it clicked the wrong thing, click it yourself.
  - You can use global keyboard hotkeys to pause or stop it at any time.

# How It's _Built Different_

* **Single Portable `Exe` - NO Installation Required** - Releases are compiled with single-exe mode, it's just one file.
   * _No_ bloated 🤡Python🤡 or 🤡NodeJS🤡 or other environment installation.
   * _ZERO_ Third-Party Dependencies 😤 (Uses core .NET Libraries and official Microsoft packages only) _#AllMyHomiesHateDependencies_
   * Ideal for running in VMs and Sandboxes. Spin up a fresh sandbox instance and it's ready to go, just set the API key.
* **Visual-Only Operation**: Works on any app, regardless of underlying framework, because it relies strictly on screen pixels.
* **Multiple AI Providers**: Supports Google Gemini (default), OpenAI (ChatGPT), and Anthropic (Claude).

### Additional Features:
* **Global Hotkey Support**: Pause, resume, or terminate the agent instantly even when the web UI is minimized.
* **Live Agent Redirection**: Issue mid-flight text instructions to the agent to override or adjust its current execution plan.
* **Config Import/Export**: Export your config options to a file and import it. Settings are also stored in the browser to survive between sessions.
* **.NET Based - Theoretically Cross Platform** - Currently the only input providers are set up for Windows, but it could work with MacOS or even Linux if someone implemented the interfaces for their APIs.

# How it Works

### The Observe-Think-Act Loop:
1. **Observe:** Captures the current desktop state as an image. It does **not** require UI Automation APIs, screen reader support, or application-specific hooks.
2. **Think:** Sends the screenshot and prompt to the AI to determine the next action.
3. **Use Input Tools:** The AI chooses the desired tool (e.g., `LEFT_CLICK`, `TYPE_TEXT`) and outputs the coordinates. Through some clever prompting tricks, this is highly reliable and accurate even with high resolution (4K) screenshots
4. **Act:** Simulates physical hardware inputs via native OS APIs (`user32.dll` / `gdi32.dll`).

### Special Sauce
- **Queued actions** - The AI can queue multiple actions where appropriate to speed through multiple similar actions, such as drawing quickly.
- **Accurate Clicking** - Prompts optimized so even on a 4K screen, the latest models can be spot-on with coordinates even for small UI elements.

### Security Notice

**⚠️ <ins>Prototype software - Not intended for production use.</ins>**<br/>
This application executes real, unauthenticated OS-level input events. Do not expose the web server port to the internet or untrusted networks. Operate only in a supervised, isolated local environment.

# Setup & Usage Instructions

### How to Download
1.  Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/ThioJoe/Thio-Universal-Agent/releases) page.
2.  For the latest release, look under `Assets` and download `Thio-Universal-Agent.exe`.

### Usage Instructions

Note: You'll need to add your own API key for your AI of choice. I'll add local model support when I get the chance.

1. Run the compiled executable. A local web interface will initialize (default: `http://localhost:51122`).
2. Navigate to the **Config** menu in the web UI.
3. Enter your required API key (e.g., Google Gemini) and adjust any desired operational parameters (model, temperature, coordinate mode). Click **Save to browser**.
4. Navigate to the **Agent Control** panel.
5. Select a target monitor, enter your task directive in the **Goal** field, and click **Start**.
6. **Interrupting Execution:** Use the Pause/Stop buttons in the UI, or the default global hotkeys (`Ctrl+Shift+Alt+P` to pause, `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S` to stop).
