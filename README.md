# 🤖 Thio's Universal Agent

An autonomous AI desktop assistant capable of host-native execution using Vision-Language Models (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude).

## How It Works (Why "Universal"?)

**Simply put, it works across the whole computer.** Unlike most AI "computer use" tools which only work in a browser or via command line, this uses the computer like you do.

It controls Windows purely through visual perception and GUI interaction. By interpreting raw pixels and sending hardware-level input (mouse movements, clicks, keystrokes), it operates exactly like a human would. This makes it **universally compatible** with any graphical application on your host machine.

It does **not** require UI Automation APIs, screen reader support, or application-specific hooks. 

## Key Features

* **Single Portable `Exe` - NO Installation Required** - Releases are compiled with single-exe mode, it's just one file.
   * _No_ bloated 🤡Python🤡 or 🤡NodeJS🤡 or other environment installation.
   * _ZERO_ Third-Party Dependencies 😤 (Uses core .NET Libraries and official Microsoft packages ONLY) _#AllMyHomiesHateDependencies_
   * Ideal for running in VMs and Sandboxes. Spin up a fresh sandbox instance and it's ready to go, just set the API key.
* **Visual-Only Operation**: Works on any app, regardless of underlying framework, because it relies strictly on screen pixels.
* **Multiple AI Providers**: Supports Google Gemini (default), OpenAI (ChatGPT), and Anthropic (Claude).

### Additional Features:
* **Web-Based Dashboard**: Built-in minimal web UI for configuring settings, starting sessions, and viewing live execution logs via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
* **Global Hotkey Support**: Pause, resume, or terminate the agent instantly even when the web UI is minimized.
* **Live Agent Redirection**: Issue mid-flight text instructions to the agent to override or adjust its current execution plan.
* **Config Import/Export**: Export your config options to a file and import it. Settings are also stored in the browser to survive between sessions.
* **.NET Based - Theoretically Cross Platform** - Currently the only input providers are set up for Windows, but it could work with MacOS or even Linux if someone implemented the interfaces for their APIs.

### ⚠️ Security Warning

**Prototype software — not intended for production use.**
This application executes real, unauthenticated OS-level input events. Do not expose the web server port to the internet or untrusted networks. Operate only in a supervised, isolated local environment.

## How it Works

### The Observe-Think-Act Loop:
1. **Observe:** Captures the current desktop state as an image.
2. **Think:** Sends the screenshot and prompt to the AI to determine the next action.
3. **Use Input Tools:** The AI chooses the desired tool (e.g., `LEFT_CLICK`, `TYPE_TEXT`) and outputs the coordinates. Through some clever prompting tricks, this is highly reliable and accurate even with high resolution (4K) screenshots
4. **Act:** Simulates physical hardware inputs via native OS APIs (`user32.dll` / `gdi32.dll`).

### Special Sauce
- **Queued actions** - The AI can queue multiple actions where appropriate to quickly send inputs to the same window, such as drawing quickly.
- **Accurate Clicking** - Prompts optimized so even on a 4K screen, the latest models can be spot-on with coordinates even for small UI elements.

## Usage Instructions

1. Run the compiled executable. A local web interface will initialize (default: `http://localhost:5112`).
2. Navigate to the **Config** menu in the web UI.
3. Enter your required API key (e.g., Google Gemini) and adjust any desired operational parameters (model, temperature, coordinate mode). Click **Save to browser**.
4. Navigate to the **Agent Control** panel.
5. Select a target monitor, enter your task directive in the **Goal** field, and click **Start**.
6. **Interrupting Execution:** Use the Pause/Stop buttons in the UI, or the default global hotkeys (`Ctrl+Shift+Alt+P` to pause, `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S` to stop).

## Development & Compilation

### Requirements:
* Visual Studio 2026
* .NET 10.0 SDK

### Instructions:

1. Open the solution file (`Thio-Universal-Agent.slnx`) in Visual Studio 2026.
2. Select your desired build configuration (`Debug` or `Release`).
3. Compile and run the solution.

## Licensing - Personal Use Only

This app is source-available. Free for PERSONAL use only. You may not use it for commercial purposes (it's not ready for production anyway).

Are you a big tech company who wants to buy it and build it out properly? I could be convinced.

I also have a lot of experience with the Windows API to help with development, as evidenced by my other projects here on GitHub.
